Python consumption and processing of the Runescape Grand Exchange api.  

This is where I will collect, process, convert (if necessary) and then save the grand exchange data to a sql database for future projects.  
I hope to build a trading bot that can accurately make predictions in item prices for in-game exchange trading, as well as a dashboard to facilitate the research of certain items on the exchange. This dashboard may, or may not be, released to the public in the future, depending on in game rules.  

The original api provides a json-response api for use in their internal website, however this site does NOT provide the kind of "fine-grained" information most players would like, such as more detail in price history, better predictions and better tracking of historically performant items.
